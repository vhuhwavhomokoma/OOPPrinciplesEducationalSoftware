        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            An object is an instance of a class. The blueprint that was established during the 
            class phase is now actualized into a specialized unit (or object).
        </p>

        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">Let us look at some examples:</p>

        <div class="mg-bottom" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="../../assets/batman_and_joker.drawio.png" width="700px" height="700px">
        </div>

        <div class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            While both Batman and the Joker are instances of the same class, `Person`, they represent two distinct 
            objects. A primary difference lies in their names: 'Batman' and 'Joker.' Additionally, the attributes of 
            each object are defined with unique values, providing specific characteristics for each instance, rather 
            than abstract concepts of the class's overall state.
        </div>

            Objects and State
        </h1>

        <div class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            Through the object's attributes, the object is able to persist it's state. A state represents what the
            object looks at a particular time t. For example, the diagram above shows the ages of both Batman and the
            Joker. This Age attribute tells us hold old each object is (state), which is likely to change the following
            year. All in all, Objects are Classes in action.
