            Inheritance
        </h1>

        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            Inheritance is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class (called a child class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., attributes and methods) from another class (called a parent class or superclass).

                    The class whose properties and behaviours are inherited is referred to as the Parent class/Super class.

            Summary
        </h1>

        <ul class="list-disc">
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Child Class/SubClass</b>: A class that inherits attributes and methods from the parent class. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Parent Class/SuperClass</b>: A class whose attributes and methods are inherited by the child class. </li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> There are five types of inheritance: Single Inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Multilevel Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance, Hybrid Inheritance.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Method Overloading</b>: allows methods in the child class to perform similar but slightly different tasks from the parent class.</li>
            <li class="poppins-medium mg-bottom"> <b>Reusability</b>: is the practice of designing and writing code in a way that allows it to be used again in different contexts without modification. </li>
