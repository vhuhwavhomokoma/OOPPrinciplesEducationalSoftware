        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            In Object-Oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint that defines the characteristics and 
            behaviors of an object. Objects are the fundamental units of data in OOP. They help us store data and 
            perform actions on that data. An object can be anything, e.g, a Person, Car or Animal are examples of objects. 
            But an object cannot exist without a blueprint or a mold that shapes that object into existence. A class is that 
            blueprint or Mold that gives life to our objects.

        <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">Let us look at some examples:</p>

        <div class="mg-bottom" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

        </div>

        <div class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            As observed from the two classes, Car and Person, we see two objects that share a similar blueprint but differ in 
            their characteristics. For instance, Batman and Bruce Wayne are distinct individuals, yet they share the same Person 
            class structure. Similarly, the car objects may vary in usability and functionality but still share the same Car class.

            Attributes and Methods
        </h1>
        
        <div class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">
            In Object-Oriented programming, we refer to the characteristics of a class as Attributes and the behavior of the 
            class as Methods. Both are used to: <br><br>
        
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;" class="mg-bottom">
                <li>Distinguish different types of classes</li>
                <li>Persist the state of a class (Attributes)</li>
                <li>Define actions to perform at each state (Methods)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="poppins-medium mg-bottom">Let us look at some examples:</p>
            
            <div class="mg-bottom" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

            The two classes represent two different objects, a Person and a Dog. Each Class has unique Attributes and Methods
            that help differentiate the class. Thus we see the important role that Attributes and Methods play in shaping the class.
