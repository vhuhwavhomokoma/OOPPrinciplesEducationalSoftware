    <h1>Relationships</h1>
    <p>
      In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), relationships between objects are fundamental to
      understanding how systems are designed and structured. These relationships define how objects
      interact and collaborate with one another. The three primary relationships in OOP are:

      <div class="relationship-card">
        <h2>1. Association:</h2>
        <p>Association is a relationship where two objects are connected or related, but neither object necessarily "owns" the other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="relationship-card aggregation">
        <h2>2. Aggregation:</h2>
        <p>Aggregation is a special type of association where one object contains another object, but both can exist independently. It is often called a "has-a" relationship.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="relationship-card composition">
        <h2>3. Composition:</h2>
        <p>Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where one object owns another, and the contained object cannot exist without the container. It is also known as a "part-of" relationship.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">4. Inheritance</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Inheritance is a relationship where one class (subclass) derives properties and behavior (methods) from another class (superclass).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-red-500">Example:</strong> A dog class can inherit from an animal class. The dog class will inherit properties like "legs" and methods like "eat" from the animal class.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">Key Point:</p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures. Itâ€™s often described as an "is-a" relationship.

        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">5. Dependency</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            A dependency exists when one class uses or depends on another class for its operation. This is typically a temporary relationship where one class relies on another.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-red-500">Example:</strong> A printer class depends on a paper class for its function. Without paper, the printer cannot print.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">Key Point:</p>
          <p>
            Dependency usually involves one class needing another class to perform its function temporarily.
