    <h1>Relationships</h1>
    <p>
      In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), relationships between objects are fundamental to
      understanding how systems are designed and structured. These relationships define how objects
      interact and collaborate with one another. The three primary relationships in OOP are:

      <div class="relationship-card">
        <h2>1. Association:</h2>
        <p>Association is a relationship where two objects are connected or related, but neither object necessarily "owns" the other.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="relationship-card aggregation">
        <h2>2. Aggregation:</h2>
        <p>Aggregation is a special type of association where one object contains another object, but both can exist independently. It is often called a "has-a" relationship.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="relationship-card composition">
        <h2>3. Composition:</h2>
        <p>Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where one object owns another, and the contained object cannot exist without the container. It is also known as a "part-of" relationship.</p>
