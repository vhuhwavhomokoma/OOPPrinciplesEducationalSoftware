      Object Interaction Role-Play: <br>
      1. Divide students into small groups. Each group will be assigned a real-world system, such as a restaurant (e.g., waiters, customers, tables, and orders) or a hospital (e.g., doctors, nurses, patients, and rooms).<br><br>
      2. Students will play the roles of these objects and act out their interactions, showcasing the different relationships (Association, Aggregation, etc).<br><br>
      3. After the role-play, ask each group to explain how the relationships they portrayed map to OOP concepts.

    <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">Examples of Real-world applications:</p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      1. Association: A social media app where users follow each other.<br>
      2. Aggregation: A music playlist containing songs. The songs can exist even without the playlist.<br>

    <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">Group Discussion</p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
      Identify real-world applications that utilize these relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance, and Dependency).
