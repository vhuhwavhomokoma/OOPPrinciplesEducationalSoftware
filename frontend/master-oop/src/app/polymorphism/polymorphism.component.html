      <div class="description">
        Polymorphism is one of the important features of object-oriented programming (OOP). So, let us explore what it is.
        The term "polymorphism" is derived from two Greek words: “poly” meaning many, and “morphism” meaning forms.
        When we combine these, we get the concept of many forms. This indicates that a single entity can take on different
        representations.<br><br>
        In practical terms, polymorphism allows a function or method to operate in multiple ways depending on the context.
        The functionality of this feature resembles its name, as one thing can be represented in various forms.
